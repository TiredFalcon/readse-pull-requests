Say a class `A` has a virtual method named `Method`, and a class `B` inherits from `A` and overrides `B`, and a third class `C` does the same to `B`, the output would be as seen in [this screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/SkTjsQC.png).\nI'm not sure if naming and code style are correct (and to be honest I'm not sure about the implementation of `CanShow()` either), which is why I'm opening this pull request early."},{"_id":"5ed967feabc35e0772a17676","closingTime":303.0,"isMerged":true,"prNumber":512,"readability":{"daleChallScore":10.534114285714287,"fleschKincaidGradeLevel":2.934285714285716,"fleschReadingEase":98.96071428571429,"papersDomainScore":8.278400000000001,"pullRequestDomainScore":8.278400000000001},"repoUrl":"https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy","text":"Change some C# 7 code to C# 6\nChanges some of my C# 7 code to C# 6, so it can be built with Visual Studio 2015.\nThis is in response to issue #510."},{"_id":"5ed967feabc35e0772a17678","closingTime":89.0,"isMerged":true,"prNumber":559,"readability":{"daleChallScore":11.699488235294117,"fleschKincaidGradeLevel":10.437401960784317,"fleschReadingEase":42.94080882352944,"papersDomainScore":10.4610568627451,"pullRequestDomainScore":10.770664705882353},"repoUrl":"https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy","text":"Keep focus when editing TreeViewItem (fixes #554)\nI added `someNode.TreeNode.TreeView.SelectItems(new[] { someNode });` to the end of all `Execute` methods of `SomeSettingsCommand` classes to reset focus back to the modified TreeNode.\nSo far this only covers active editing, not undo/redo.
