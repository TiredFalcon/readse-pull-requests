This is allows for the data to be extracted between the end of the first run and the start of the second run. \n",

The original midweight Pieces had Light armor bindings that matched the light armor pieces so I used the light armor materials as a baseline for the midweight bindings. I know that having a material as common as diamond/ruby/etc be a standalone binding may be a slight compatability hazard, but doing it this way saves a considerable amount of syntax and nothing stood out as being broken by it so I went for it. If you want me to redo the base bindings as Light (+gem material) and add a new spot for Midweight (+gem Material) let me know in the pull request comments and I will change them up when I see it. I used thick as a midweight binding because it made sense statistically and to a lesser extent conceptually.\n",

      "This lays the foundation for the Redux work I want to prepare before working on caching API requests. Converts the existing action/reducer structure to use [redux-actions](https://github.com/redux-utilities/redux-actions). We want to consolidate hardcoded strings into an easily accessible list, and namespace actions because we tend to use them around each other.\n",
