      "\n",
      "It then restructures the response payload on login, register, and refresh token to maintain backwards compatibility by maintaining the previous response type as a subset of the new response. This allows new clients to get what they need, while old clients remain unchanged.\n",

      "Log the running API version on startup\n",

      "1. To reduce the sheer number of files and folders in the `src` directory\n",
      "2. To have the folders located at the root of `src` oriented around **system capabilities**, so that it is easier for developers to step through the code base when looking for something specific\n",

      "____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
      "Speed Up Tests\n",
      "This speeds up tests by returning the result of the `MongoDriver` disconnect function so that teardown doesn't hang as long. It also removes the integration test stage from CircleCI that was not actually running anything useful.\n",

      "____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
      "Write Learning Object Meta to Storage\n",
      "This PR adds a new publishing artifact, `meta.json`. This file contains all metadata for a Learning Object at the time of publishing a revision, so that we do not have to store data for old revisions in the database.\n",
      "____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
      "Change delete to remove\n",
      "Tiny change here so I figured I would put it in myself. It simply changes the word `delete` to `remove` in the confirmation dialog when deleting a child in the builder.\n",
      "\n",

      "Fix user resource authentication error\n",
      "This PR moves the `UserMetaRetriever` Module to the public routes section of the middleware stack to allow visitors to CLARK to load user's profiles. \n",
      "\n",
      "The `UserMetaRetriever` module does contain a route to access the roles of a user as well, which should in fact be private. This is handled by the existing business logic for the functionality and with these changes still returns a `401` when an unauthenticated party makes a request.\n",
      "____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
      "Fix /users/tokens returns a 404\n",
      "This PR adds a temporary check to the `/users/:username` route handler to forward it's request in the middleware stack if the `username` provided is `tokens`.
